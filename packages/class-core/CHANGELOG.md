# Changelog

## 0.6.13

* Add a getter `referenceTargets` to `INodeBase` that – like the `children` getter for containments – returns an array of all nodes targeted by reference features (direct and inherited) of the classifier of the node.
    *Note* that these getters are (in principle) meant *for internal use only*!
